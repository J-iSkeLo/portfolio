                                The beginning of my programming started at the end of
                                2019. Since I was working at a hard job (where you
                                have to work physically) and in poor conditions, it
                                encouraged me to change my line of work. At that
                                time, my brother Sergey was a fullstack developer and
                                he suggested me to try my hand at development.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Among all the programming languages, I settled on
                                Java. Why Java? Most likely, because it was one of
                                the most popular programming languages and after
                                learning Java many other OOP languages become clear.
                                Having started learning the language by watching
                                tutorial videos, I started trying to write desktop
                                applications like calculator, Saper game and similar.
                                During this study, I learned that Java can be used to
                                write mobile applications for Android devices, which
                                I was very interested in.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Smartphones occupy a huge time of our lives, now
                                without it is very difficult. And so I decided that I
                                need to write applications on Android, you need to
                                try to learn! According to the video lessons I wrote
                                a few applications something like notes, where I
                                worked with the database and basic features of
                                Android Jetpack, as well as with AsyncTask.

                            <MyLifeTitle header="2. First Android application (JAVA)">
                                It's been a year since I started learning programming
                                (it's fall 2020) and finally decided to write a
                                full-fledged project, but I needed an idea: "What
                                kind of app should I write?".
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                At this time I worked for a company for the
                                production and sale of aquarium fish and equipment,
                                where I was directly involved in the breeding of
                                fish. I offered the managers my idea of writing an
                                application in which users can conveniently in a
                                couple of clicks to fill the cart and place an order.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Of course, the application would be difficult to
                                exist on its own, without a backend and admin panel
                                with which managers could control the availability of
                                goods and add images. For these tasks I connected my
                                brother, he liked the idea. We agreed on the sums and
                                started to create this project combining our main job
                                (fish farming) and writing code in our free time.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It was a great experience, for the first application
                                that serves Aqua-M until now.
                            </MyLifeTitle>

                            <MyLifeTitle header="3. Kotlin and Architecture (MVVM) / Project Manager">
                                After this experience I realized that I should try
                                myself only as a developer and started working on
                                Freelancehunt. I said goodbye to Aqua-M and just
                                starting to learn Kotlin, which I had already heard
                                about on YouTube, I got a call from my future client
                                with a proposal to write him an application for a pet
                                store ZooZooZoo. As it turned out ZooZooZoo
                                cooperated with Aqua-M. Having asked them who wrote
                                such an application for Aqua-M, they gave my
                                contacts.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                And so I started to deal with the second application,
                                which also lives in the PlayStore. Backend and web
                                was Sergey. I was dealing with Android application
                                and project management. Since it is easier for the
                                client to communicate with one and the one who
                                understood more than him in the development. Since
                                the beginning of 2021 and until May this year, I was
                                actively engaged in the project until the release.

                            <MyLifeTitle header="4. The search for self">
                                Having released the app ZooZooZoo on PlayStore, I
                                wanted to get experience working in a team and try
                                myself in other apps, not only in sales. I started
                                looking for a job in an office where I could come and
                                communicate with like-minded people. And of course
                                development in such walls happens with greater speed.
                                I tried myself at interviews in Nix, Impulse and a
                                couple of other companies, but less famous and in
                                most cases I was cut off after checking my English.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                His level needed to be conversational, with which I
                                had a problem (now much better, but of course not
                                free). And one of these days I got a call from
                                Dmitry, the head of Syject, with a proposal to come
                                to their office and have an interview. I realized
                                that I don't want to set anyone up and waste my time,
                                I told him about my weak English, and Dmitry replied,
                                "It's not a problem, the main thing is that you
                                should be able to read and write in English" and of
                                course it's not a problem to help translators. I was
                                happy and of course I agreed to the interview in the
                                office. We agreed on the date and time.
                            </MyLifeTitle>

                            <MyLifeTitle header="5. My first company – Syject">
                                Coming to the office, I saw a small room in which
                                there were 4 people and was very surprised that the
                                team is very small, it is not what I expected, but
                                starting to communicate with Dmitry I learned that
                                this is just a small part of the team with the
                                designer and managers, and the main team on another
                                floor (and the truth team was as I wanted, not big
                                but full-fledged where each took its role but were
                                one team). The interview did not last long, the
                                questions were simple, I coped without problems.
                                Dmitry checked my English level. After that we said
                                goodbye and I had to wait for the result, of course I
                                was not the only candidate. At the end of the week I
                                got a call from Dimitri with a proposal to start
                                working with Syject.

                                Syject became a second home for me, I always came to
                                work in a good mood and enjoyed spending time with
                                the team. Warm welcome, conversations under hookah,
                                video game competitions always made me happy and left
                                only good emotions.

                                On February 24, 2022 the war began, we woke up to
                                explosions and the sound of fighter jets overhead. No
                                one could think of work, we hid in the basement and
                                waited for good news until we got the idea to get out
                                to a safer place outside the city. We found someone
                                who was able to get us out early in the morning when
                                the activity of fighting and shelling was least.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Once we were in a safe place and most of the team
                                (coworkers) were also able to leave within 10-14
                                days, we contacted management to find out what we
                                needed and could work further. Dmitry provided those
                                who needed, equipment for remote work. And we
                                continued our cooperation. At the beginning of 2023,
                                in February, it so happened that there were no more
                                Android projects at Syject. By mutual agreement we
                                decided to part ways, I needed development, and
                                Syject didn't need an Android developer yet.

                                I immediately started repeating the theory and
                                looking for a new company. In the conditions of the
                                war it turned out to be quite difficult, as we (me
                                and my family) were not ready to move to big cities,
                                where it is more dangerous than in the small town
                                where we lived. I received an offer from a company in
                                Kiev, but with a mandatory condition to move.
                                Unfortunately, I had to decline and look further
                                afield. In the meantime, I studied Jetpack Compose,
                                which came in handy in the future.

                                After 3 months, Dmitry approached me again with a
                                request to help me with a project they started
                                writing a month ago. Within two days I fixed the
                                problems, after which I was offered to replace the
                                developer on new terms and continue writing the
                                project on Jetpack Compose, which I could not refuse.
                                After working for a month, the client and the company
                                had problems with the arrangements and the contracts
                                were broken. These are internal company matters,
                                where I do not interfere and do not advise anyone.
                                Once again our paths with Syject diverged.

                                within a week, I received an offer of employment from
                                a US-based company working on a "Higher Bond" project
                                on Jetpack Compose. The deadline was ambitious, but I
                                recognised the benefits I could offer and accepted
                                the offer. "Higher Bond" is a Christ-centred dating
                                app based on biblical values.

                                From July 2023 to March 2024, I was responsible for
                                the creation of a functional native Android app,
                                which was successfully released on Google Play. This
                                project provided a welcome opportunity to gain
                                experience with Jetpack Compose and related
                                technologies such as Coil, Koin Compose, Navigation
                                Compose, Paging Compose and Lottie Compose.
                                Additionally, I gained valuable experience with
                                SignalR from Microsoft, as the application utilised
                                the hub connection for almost all events. Prior to
                                this, I had worked with SignalR in the Arabica
                                project, which facilitated the seamless integration
                                of customised hub connections.

                                In March 2024, the primary development phase of the
                                application concluded, and I completed my assigned
                                tasks.

                            <MyLifeTitle header="10. “Hockey Insight” – a collaborative project with Anton Patenko">
                                I resumed my search for new employment opportunities
                                while concurrently embarking on a joint project
                                entitled "Hockey Insight" with my colleague Anton
                                Patenko. Anton is an iOS developer and a keen NHL fan
                                who proposed the idea of creating a useful app for
                                tracking the results and schedules of users'
                                favourite team's matches.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Following extensive discussions and meetings, we
                                initiated the search for the necessary API and began
                                designing the application in Figma. Following the
                                creation of all necessary resources and the
                                identification of a suitable API, the development
                                phase was initiated. For the "Hockey Insight"
                                project, I decided to use Jetpack Compose along with
                                its "ecosystem". The chosen architecture is MVVM +
                                MVI.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                For network requests, I used OkHttp4 and Retrofit2;
                                for dependency injection, Koin; for annotation
                                processors, KSP; and for working with image , Coil is
                                currently the best option for use with Jetpack
                                Compose. Navigation is written with Compose
                                Navigation. For writing asynchronous tasks, I used
                                Coroutines along with all the features of this
                                asynchronous wonder. The project was completed within
                                a 2-month timeframe and has been successfully
                                published on both the Google Play and App Store
                                platforms.

                            <MyLifeTitle header="11. One of Ukraine’s largest">
                                After the release of "Hockey Insight" in app stores,
                                I actively began going through interviews. On May 28,
                                2024, I had an interview with a large company, "GC
                                Foxtrot." The interview left a good impression, and I
                                was confident that I would be a good fit for them.
                                The retail chain Foxtrot is one of the largest in
                                Ukraine in terms of the number of stores and the
                                volume of electronics and household appliances sales.
                                And already on May 30, I received an offer, after
                                which I was registered as an employee over the course
                                of 10 days and started working.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The project is very large, the architecture is mainly
                                MVVM, but the team started implementing Jetpack
                                Compose to replace XML, and with it, the MVI
                                architecture came along. The project has a huge
                                number of third-party libraries, from which I have
                                gradually started to get rid of and use native
                                solutions. For dependency injection, Dagger2 was
                                used. Over time, I moved from Groovy to Kotlin DSL
                                and from Dagger2 to Koin, as Dagger2 is poorly
                                supported and there is and no support KSP on which I
                                switched with Kapt. I also removed the remnants of Rx
                                from the project, leaving only coroutines, and the
                                project has taken on a new look that is pleasant to
                                work with and maintain. At the moment, I am working
                                on the "Foxtrot" project and I want to grow together
                                with them. Next will be...
