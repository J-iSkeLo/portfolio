        review: `
        I've helped Olexiy to get started with Android development with Java back in 2020 when he was transitioning from a different field into software development. It's an honor for me to be the first who was not only helping him to learn Java, but also being the first person he worked with.

        Olexiy is an eager learner and a disciplined programmer, always focused on delivering quality work. I'm amazed by his attention to details and his refactoring nature. I highly recommend üëç Olexiy as a software developer for any organization or project looking for someone who is dedicated, reliable, and has a passion for not just coding but for clean and maintainable code.

        We worked together on multiple, projects where I was providing the server-side APIs and WEB applications, while Olexiy was responsible for the Android app development and project management, as he dealt with the client directly.

        I will continue to work with Olexiy in the future, and make sure I always have his back. If you are looking for a skilled and reliable software developer, look no further than Olexiy. I am proud to recommend Olexiy as a software developer, who possesses not only technical skills but also project management and communication skills.
