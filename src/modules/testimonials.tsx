                    We would like to thank Olexiy for the offer to make an app for
                    our business. This allowed us to update and send information to
                    our customers more quickly. Orders from customers began to arrive
                    much more often, all of them immediately noted the convenience of
                    using the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, the application allowed us to increase sales volumes
                    and effectively use the working time of the sales department. We
                    were satisfied with the result, we can recommend Olexiy üëç

                months, it took only 5 weeks to develop, the application with a tie
                to the site was ready and working. Thanks for the speed and quality.

                    I've helped Olexiy to get started with Android development with
                    Java back in 2020 when he was transitioning from a different
                    field into software development. It's an honor for me to be the
                    first who was not only helping him to learn Java, but also being
                    the first person he worked with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Olexiy is an eager learner and a disciplined programmer, always
                    focused on delivering quality work. I'm amazed by his attention
                    to details and his refactoring nature. I highly recommend üëç
                    Olexiy as a software developer for any organization or project
                    looking for someone who is dedicated, reliable, and has a passion
                    for not just coding but for clean and maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We worked together on multiple, projects where I was providing
                    the server-side APIs and WEB applications, while Olexiy was
                    responsible for the Android app development and project
                    management, as he dealt with the client directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will continue to work with Olexiy in the future, and make sure
                    I always have his back. If you are looking for a skilled and
                    reliable software developer, look no further than Olexiy. I am
                    proud to recommend Olexiy as a software developer, who possesses
                    not only technical skills but also project management and
                    communication skills.
